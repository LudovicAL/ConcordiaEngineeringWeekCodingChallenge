THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
HENCE TO FIGHT AND CONQUER IN ALL YOUR BATTLES IS NOT SUPREME EXCELLENCE SUPREME EXCELLENCE CONSISTS IN BREAKING THE ENEMYS RESISTANCE WITHOUT FIGHTING 
THUS THE HIGHEST FORM OF GENERALSHIP IS TO BALK THE ENEMYS PLANS THE NEXT BEST IS TO PREVENT THE JUNCTION OF THE ENEMYS FORCES THE NEXT IN ORDER IS TO ATTACK THE ENEMYS ARMY IN THE FIELD AND THE WORST POLICY OF ALL IS TO BESIEGE WALLED CITIES 
THE RULE IS NOT TO BESIEGE WALLED CITIES IF IT CAN POSSIBLY BE AVOIDED
THE PREPARATION OF MANTLETS MOVABLE SHELTERS AND VARIOUS IMPLEMENTS OF WAR WILL TAKE UP THREE WHOLE MONTHS AND THE PILING UP OF MOUNDS OVER AGAINST THE WALLS WILL TAKE THREE MONTHS MORE 
THE GENERAL UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS IRRITATION WILL LAUNCH HIS MEN TO THE ASSAULT LIKE SWARMING ANTS WITH THE RESULT THAT ONETHIRD OF HIS MEN ARE SLAIN WHILE THE TOWN STILL REMAINS UNTAKEN
SUCH ARE THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF A SIEGE 
THEREFORE THE SKILLFUL LEADER SUBDUES THE ENEMYS TROOPS WITHOUT ANY FIGHTING HE CAPTURES THEIR CITIES WITHOUT LAYING SIEGE TO THEM HE OVERTHROWS THEIR KINGDOM WITHOUT LENGTHY OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD 
WITH HIS FORCES INTACT HE WILL DISPUTE THE MASTERY OF THE EMPIRE AND THUS WITHOUT LOSING A MAN HIS TRIUMPH WILL BE COMPLETE THIS IS THE METHOD OF ATTACKING BY STRATAGEM 
IT IS THE RULE IN WAR IF OUR FORCES ARE TEN TO THE ENEMYS ONE TO SURROUND HIM IF FIVE TO ONE TO ATTACK HIM IF TWICE AS NUMEROUS TO DIVIDE OUR ARMY INTO TWO 
IF EQUALLY MATCHED WE CAN OFFER BATTLE IF SLIGHTLY INFERIOR IN NUMBERS WE CAN AVOID THE ENEMY IF QUITE UNEQUAL IN EVERY WAY WE CAN FLEE FROM HIM 
HENCE THOUGH AN OBSTINATE FIGHT MAY BE MADE BY A SMALL FORCE IN THE END IT MUST BE CAPTURED BY THE LARGER FORCE 
NOW THE GENERAL IS THE BULWARK OF THE STATE IF THE BULWARK IS COMPLETE AT ALL POINTS THE STATE WILL BE STRONG IF THE BULWARK IS DEFECTIVE THE STATE WILL BE WEAK 
THERE ARE THREE WAYS IN WHICH A RULER CAN BRING MISFORTUNE UPON HIS ARMY 
BY COMMANDING THE ARMY TO ADVANCE OR TO RETREAT BEING IGNORANT OF THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT OBEY THIS IS CALLED HOBBLING THE ARMY
BY ATTEMPTING TO GOVERN AN ARMY IN THE SAME WAY AS HE ADMINISTERS A KINGDOM BEING IGNORANT OF THE CONDITIONS WHICH OBTAIN IN AN ARMY THIS CAUSES RESTLESSNESS IN THE SOLDIERS MINDS
BY EMPLOYING THE OFFICERS OF HIS ARMY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION THROUGH IGNORANCE OF THE MILITARY PRINCIPLE OF ADAPTATION TO CIRCUMSTANCES THIS SHAKES THE CONFIDENCE OF THE SOLDIERS 
BUT WHEN THE ARMY IS RESTLESS AND DISTRUSTFUL TROUBLE IS SURE TO COME FROM THE OTHER FEUDAL PRINCES THIS IS SIMPLY BRINGING ANARCHY INTO THE ARMY AND FLINGING VICTORY AWAY 
THUS WE MAY KNOW THAT THERE ARE FIVE ESSENTIALS FOR VICTORY
HE WILL WIN WHO KNOWS WHEN TO FIGHT AND WHEN NOT TO FIGHT
HE WILL WIN WHO KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE BOTH SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR FORCES
HE WILL WIN WHOSE ARMY IS ANIMATED BY THE SAME SPIRIT THROUGHOUT ALL ITS RANKS
HE WILL WIN WHO PREPARED HIMSELF WAITS TO TAKE THE ENEMY UNPREPARED
HE WILL WIN WHO HAS MILITARY CAPACITY AND IS NOT INTERFERED WITH BY THE SOVEREIGN 
THEREFORE THE CLEVER COMBATANT IMPOSES HIS WILL ON THE ENEMY BUT DOES NOT ALLOW THE ENEMYS WILL TO BE IMPOSED ON HIM 
BY HOLDING OUT ADVANTAGES TO HIM HE CAN CAUSE THE ENEMY TO APPROACH OF HIS OWN ACCORD OR BY INFLICTING DAMAGE HE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ENEMY TO DRAW NEAR 
IF THE ENEMY IS TAKING HIS EASE HE CAN HARASS HIM IF WELL SUPPLIED WITH FOOD HE CAN STARVE HIM OUT IF QUIETLY ENCAMPED HE CAN FORCE HIM TO MOVE 
APPEAR AT POINTS WHICH THE ENEMY MUST HASTEN TO DEFEND MARCH SWIFTLY TO PLACES WHERE YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED 
AN ARMY MAY MARCH GREAT DISTANCES WITHOUT DISTRESS IF IT MARCHES THROUGH COUNTRY WHERE THE ENEMY IS NOT 
THE CODING CHALLENGE SUBMITION PAGE IS ENGWEEKDOTCASLASHCODFIRST
HENCE THAT GENERAL IS SKILLFUL IN ATTACK WHOSE OPPONENT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DEFEND AND HE IS SKILLFUL IN DEFENSE WHOSE OPPONENT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO ATTACK 
O DIVINE ART OF SUBTLETY AND SECRECY THROUGH YOU WE LEARN TO BE INVISIBLE THROUGH YOU INAUDIBLE AND HENCE WE CAN HOLD THE ENEMYS FATE IN OUR HANDS 
YOU MAY ADVANCE AND BE ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE IF YOU MAKE FOR THE ENEMYS WEAK POINTS YOU MAY RETIRE AND BE SAFE FROM PURSUIT IF YOUR MOVEMENTS ARE MORE RAPID THAN THOSE OF THE ENEMY 
IF WE WISH TO FIGHT THE ENEMY CAN BE FORCED TO AN ENGAGEMENT EVEN THOUGH HE BE SHELTERED BEHIND A HIGH RAMPART AND A DEEP DITCH 
ALL WE NEED DO IS ATTACK SOME OTHER PLACE THAT HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO RELIEVE 
IF WE DO NOT WISH TO FIGHT WE CAN PREVENT THE ENEMY FROM ENGAGING US EVEN THOUGH THE LINES OF OUR ENCAMPMENT BE MERELY TRACED OUT ON THE GROUND 
ALL WE NEED DO IS TO THROW SOMETHING ODD AND UNACCOUNTABLE IN HIS WAY 
BY DISCOVERING THE ENEMYS DISPOSITIONS AND REMAINING INVISIBLE OURSELVES WE CAN KEEP OUR FORCES CONCENTRATED WHILE THE ENEMYS MUST BE DIVIDED 
WE CAN FORM A SINGLE UNITED BODY WHILE THE ENEMY MUST SPLIT UP INTO FRACTIONS HENCE THERE WILL BE A WHOLE PITTED AGAINST SEPARATE PARTS OF A WHOLE WHICH MEANS THAT WE SHALL BE MANY TO THE ENEMYS FEW 
AND IF WE ARE ABLE THUS TO ATTACK AN INFERIOR FORCE WITH A SUPERIOR ONE OUR OPPONENTS WILL BE IN DIRE STRAITS 
THE SPOT WHERE WE INTEND TO FIGHT MUST NOT BE MADE KNOWN FOR THEN THE ENEMY WILL HAVE TO PREPARE AGAINST A POSSIBLE ATTACK AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT POINTS AND HIS FORCES BEING THUS DISTRIBUTED IN MANY DIRECTIONS THE NUMBERS WE SHALL HAVE TO FACE AT ANY GIVEN POINT WILL BE PROPORTIONATELY FEW 
FOR SHOULD THE ENEMY STRENGTHEN HIS VAN HE WILL WEAKEN HIS REAR SHOULD HE STRENGTHEN HIS REAR HE WILL WEAKEN HIS VAN SHOULD HE STRENGTHEN HIS LEFT HE WILL WEAKEN HIS RIGHT SHOULD HE STRENGTHEN HIS RIGHT HE WILL WEAKEN HIS LEFT IF HE SENDS REINFORCEMENTS EVERYWHERE HE WILL EVERYWHERE BE WEAK 
NUMERICAL WEAKNESS COMES FROM HAVING TO PREPARE AGAINST POSSIBLE ATTACKS NUMERICAL STRENGTH FROM COMPELLING OUR ADVERSARY TO MAKE THESE PREPARATIONS AGAINST US 
KNOWING THE PLACE AND THE TIME OF THE COMING BATTLE WE MAY CONCENTRATE FROM THE GREATEST DISTANCES IN ORDER TO FIGHT 
BUT IF NEITHER TIME NOR PLACE BE KNOWN THEN THE LEFT WING WILL BE IMPOTENT TO SUCCOR THE RIGHT THE RIGHT EQUALLY IMPOTENT TO SUCCOR THE LEFT THE VAN UNABLE TO RELIEVE THE REAR OR THE REAR TO SUPPORT THE VAN HOW MUCH MORE SO IF THE FURTHEST PORTIONS OF THE ARMY ARE ANYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED LI APART AND EVEN THE NEAREST ARE SEPARATED BY SEVERAL LI 
THOUGH ACCORDING TO MY ESTIMATE THE SOLDIERS OF YUEH EXCEED OUR OWN IN NUMBER THAT SHALL ADVANTAGE THEM NOTHING IN THE MATTER OF VICTORY I SAY THEN THAT VICTORY CAN BE ACHIEVED 
THOUGH THE ENEMY BE STRONGER IN NUMBERS WE MAY PREVENT HIM FROM FIGHTING SCHEME SO AS TO DISCOVER HIS PLANS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR SUCCESS 
ROUSE HIM AND LEARN THE PRINCIPLE OF HIS ACTIVITY OR INACTIVITY FORCE HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF SO AS TO FIND OUT HIS VULNERABLE SPOTS 
CAREFULLY COMPARE THE OPPOSING ARMY WITH YOUR OWN SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHERE STRENGTH IS SUPER ABUNDANT AND WHERE IT IS DEFICIENT 
IN MAKING TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS THE HIGHEST PITCH YOU CAN ATTAIN IS TO CONCEAL THEM CONCEAL YOUR DISPOSITIONS AND YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM THE PRYING OF THE SUBTLEST SPIES FROM THE MACHINATIONS OF THE WISEST BRAINS 
HOW VICTORY MAY BE PRODUCED FOR THEM OUT OF THE ENEMYS OWN TACTICS THAT IS WHAT THE MULTITUDE CANNOT COMPREHEND 
ALL MEN CAN SEE THE TACTICS WHEREBY I CONQUER BUT WHAT NONE CAN SEE IS THE STRATEGY OUT OF WHICH VICTORY IS EVOLVED 
DO NOT REPEAT THE TACTICS WHICH HAVE GAINED YOU ONE VICTORY BUT LET YOUR METHODS BE REGULATED BY THE INFINITE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
MILITARY TACTICS ARE LIKE UNTO WATER FOR WATER IN ITS NATURAL COURSE RUNS AWAY FROM HIGH PLACES AND HASTENS DOWNWARDS 
SO IN WAR THE WAY IS TO AVOID WHAT IS STRONG AND TO STRIKE AT WHAT IS WEAK 
WATER SHAPES ITS COURSE ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE GROUND OVER WHICH IT FLOWS THE SOLDIER WORKS OUT HIS VICTORY IN RELATION TO THE FOE WHOM HE IS FACING 
THEREFORE JUST AS WATER RETAINS NO CONSTANT SHAPE SO IN WARFARE THERE ARE NO CONSTANT CONDITIONS 
HE WHO CAN MODIFY HIS TACTICS IN RELATION TO HIS OPPONENT AND THEREBY SUCCEED IN WINNING MAY BE CALLED A HEAVENBORN CAPTAIN 
THE FIVE ELEMENTS WATER FIRE WOOD METAL EARTH ARE NOT ALWAYS EQUALLY PREDOMINANT THE FOUR SEASONS MAKE WAY FOR EACH OTHER IN TURN THERE ARE SHORT DAYS AND LONG THE MOON HAS ITS PERIODS OF WANING AND WAXING
